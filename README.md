# knightsTour
A simple GUI to demonstrate the Knight's Tour problem. The knight will tour the board starting from a randomly chosen square on the chess board

## Built With

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - The language used
* [Pygame 1.9](https://www.pygame.org/news) - The Python library used

## Possible features and additions
* Add a sound for when the knight moves to a new square and an option to disable it
* Add a way for the user to adjust the knight's movement speed
* Allow the user to choose which square the knight will start on
* Make the button "feel" more like a button
* Create a text file that the user can access that has the list of moves that the knight takes
* Have the knight leave numbers on the squares it has already visited in order and an option to disable it

## Optimizations
* Have a background file that keeps previous knight's tour paths so that a new path isn't generated if a path from a given square is already known
* Reduce the number of constant values

## Other
* Add documentation
